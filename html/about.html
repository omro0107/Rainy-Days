                        <p>The textile industry accounts for almost 10% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. 
                            This amounts to 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2. It is more than both air and ship traffic combined. 
                            Every year, the clothing industry consumes 93 billion cubic meters of water. This corresponds to the water consumption of 5 million people.
                            We focus on sustainable materials, and want to minimize our footprint on the planet.</p>
                        <p>Five percent of our profit goes to climate compensation. 
                            It is also possible to exchange your old Rainydays clothes in our stores and get a voucher in return.</p>
